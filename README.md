# HOW TO RUN

## Installations
- Install all the dependencies from ```requirements.txt```
- Install [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)
  
## Database setup
- In this project we use postgres as the database engine.
- Create a database and name it 'MultimediaDB'.
- Run the sql script inside ```/DB-create``` directory.

## Data population
- Once the db table has been created, the next step is to process all the videos to be inserted into the database.
- All videos are present in the ```/DB-populate/videos``` directory.
- All videos must be named as videoX.mp4 where X is an integer value.
- Run
    ~~~
    chmod +x generate-json
    ./generate-json
    ~~~
- This generates json objects and adds them to the ```/DB-populate/videos_json``` directory.
- Run
    ~~~
     chmod +x insertAllVideos
     ./insertAllVideos
    ~~~
- This inserts all the json objects to the database.
  
## Querying
- Now the database is populated and ready to be queried.
- Clear the ```queries/tesing``` directory and insert the video query.
- Run 
    ~~~
    chmod +x query
    ./query
    ~~~
- This finds the video number and the starting time of the query clip in the video.
- Uncomment ```line #61``` in ```query.py``` to view the video in VLC player.
